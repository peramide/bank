💸 Bank Greeting Program — Inspired by Seinfeld (Season 7, Episode 24). This Python script prompts a user for a greeting and returns a “reward” based on how it starts:  “hello” → $0  starts with “h” → $20  otherwise → $100  Whitespace and case are ignored.



## How It Works

The program prompts you for a greeting.

It normalizes the input (removes spaces, ignores case).

Based on the first few characters, it determines your “reward.”

It prints the result to the console.
